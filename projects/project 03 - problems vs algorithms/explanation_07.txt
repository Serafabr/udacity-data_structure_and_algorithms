Code Design:

    Data Structures used: 
        - Trie
        - Hash Table
        
    Explanation: 
        - A Trie was used to facilitate finding all relative paths from some url. Each node of the tree represents a relative path of the
        url. And if a path is child of other path, it means that it is the continuation on the url.
        Hash table was used to facilitate finding the child of each node (next relative path).


Efficiency:

    Space Efficiency: O(n) - n is the number of relative paths.
        - Explanation: Each relative path will be saved on some node on the trie. For instance, in '/home/about/me' we will need
        three nodes (home, about and me).

    Operation: Router.add_handler()
    
        Time Complexity - O(m), where m is the number of relative paths (it can be roughly O(1))
        Explanation - It needs to check each relative path on the url. Since the number of relative paths doesn't increase a lot,
        we can consider that time complexity is roughly O(1)
    
    Operation: Router.lookup()

        Time Complexity - O(m), where m is the number of the relative paths (it can be roughly O(1))
        Explanation - It needs to check each relative path on the url. Since the number of relative paths doesn't increase a lot,
        we can consider that time complexity is roughly O(1)
