Code Design:

    Algorithm used: 
        - Traverse the list once
        
    Explanation: 
        - Check every element on the list and save it on a new variable if it's greater than the greatest element until now,
        or smaller than the smallest element until now.


Efficiency:

    Space Efficiency: O(1)
        - Explanation: The algorithm doesn't need to create a copy of this list.

    Operation: get_min_max(ints)
    
        Time Complexity - O(n)
        Explanation - It needs to check each item of the list just once.
