Code Design:

    Algorithm used: 
        - Binary Search (divide and conquer)
        
    Explanation: 
        - On every iteration the algorithm check the number divided by 2 (n // 2) and multiplied by itself. If the result is equal 
        to the initial number, we've found sqrt(n), otherwise keep searching on the right part.


Efficiency:

    Space Efficiency: O(1)
        
        Explanation: The size of the number doesn't alter the space used by the algorithm.

    Operation: sqrt(n)
    
        Time Complexity - O(log n)
        Explanation - On each iteration we divide the problem in the middle. So, we have a time complexity of O(log n)
