Code Design:

    Algorithm used: 
        - Traverse the list
        
    Explanation: 
        - The algorithm will check every number. If it's 0, send it to the beggining. If it's 2, send it to the end of the list.


Efficiency:

    Space Efficiency: O(n)
        
        - Explanation: It doesn't execute in place on the list. It creates a new list, in order to not mutate the initial input.

    Operation: sort_012(input_list)
    
        Time Complexity - O(n)
        Explanation - The algorithm will traverse the list (will check every number just once). So, time complexity is O(n)
